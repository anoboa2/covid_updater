## Backstory

As part of my regular search of side projects, my brother came to me with a problem that he faced at his work.  As a producer for a major news network, he needs a daily aggregation of covid19 reports, so that he can help decide on news segments and report on the latest trending covid19 information.  The information was requested to be shared into a Google Doc, so that it could readily be found updated in the same location every day.

This tool was not used as an official aggregator for the news network, but as a quick and simple way to aggregate data in the early days of the pandemic.

This tool could be further enhanced to build more comprehensive dashboards and applications should more features be defined.
